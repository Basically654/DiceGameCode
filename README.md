Began working on techincal process of the game. Dice rolling, computer opponent, sound effects, and background  
Learned the mechanics of sound design and user interface  
Many lines of code are uneeded but getting rid of them would require a tedious amount of work  
Commenting what I would like to get done so I am not confused about what lines do what would be beneficial  
Focused on doing one thing at a time and didn't worry about what I would need to implement next
